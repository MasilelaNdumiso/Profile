st.markdown("I am a dedicated and detail-oriented Hydrologist with a strong foundation in the National Water Act (Act 36 of 1998) with over three years of experience in South Africaâ€™s national water monitoring programs. My expertise includes performance monitoring, drought risk management, and data management for the National Integrated Water Information System (NIWIS). I am a Professional Natural Scientist (SACNASP), proficient in hydrological modeling and flow routing using MIKE+ Rivers, MODFLOW, and HEC-RAS for water resources system operations, Geographical Information Systems, Satellite-based Remote Sensing, and advanced data management using R-Scripts and Python programming languages. My experience includes processing, analyzing, and interpreting various hydrological and spatial data, including expertise in High-Performance Computing (HPC) for large-scale data analysis. Additionally, I have co-authored peer-reviewed publications contributing to hydrological drought monitoring and groundwater assessment in South Africa.")
